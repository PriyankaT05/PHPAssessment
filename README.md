# Overview

This is an assessment to display the most starred public PHP projects in GitHub. It consits of some client code (html, css, javascript) that makes calls to files hosted on a web server (php). 

The server queries the GitHub API's search/repositories endpoint: 'https://api.github.com/search/repositories' for repository information and stores the information in a MySQL database. Then it can retrieve that information to create HTML to send to the client.

The query I used to hit the GitHub API to retreive a list of the most starred PHP projects is 
   **https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=stars:%3E10000+language:php+is:public**   
(Public repositories with the language tag PHP and more than 10,000 stars is what I considered as the most starred PHP projects)

**css/style.css** - Adding our own styles

**includes/create_table.sql** - Sql query to create 'repositories' table in 'php_assessment' database in localhost's MySQL Server (see XAMPP dashboard)

**inlcudes/debug.log** - this log file is overwritten everytime refresh_database.php is executed. It contains helpful development information about success/failure of connecting to the MySQL database and cURL execution of the API query and the code-generated insert statements.

**inlcudes/refresh_database.php** - this file performs two things in sequence
    1. Queries the repositories table for repository information.
    2. Iterates through the repository data received and outputs HTML to return to the client.

**inlcudes/refresh_database.php** - this file performs three things in sequence
    1. Create 'repositories' table and schema in php_assessment database of localhost's MySQL server if it doesn't exist.
    2. Query the GitHub API to retreive a list of the most starred PHP projects in serialized JSON format. Public repositories with the language tag PHP and more than 10,000 stars are considered "most starred PHP projects". 
    3. Creates and executes a SQL query to insert values into our repositories table.
    **NOTE - I had to modify the API search parameters to get repositories starred between 15000 and 33000, since there's INSERT ANOMALY while getting all starred repositories greater than 10000. Hence the query I used in the code is as below: 
    https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=stars:15000..33000+language:php+is:public**
    
**inlcudes/send_message.php** - this file is included in refresh_database.php and refresh_client.php. It creates a Materialize card with a message on what the server encountered.

**js/main.js** - contains the Javascript necessary to make calls to the server and update the client's browser with received information and initiates collapsible function.

**index.php** - Finally, this page is served to the client initially that allows them to make calls via main.js to refresh the database or the client via two buttons.

**Route #1 **

  Client sends default request to [[SERVER_ADDRESS]]/php_assessment/index.php
  OR
  Client clicks REFRESH DATABASE to send HTTP request to php_assessment/includes/refresh_database.php via main.js function refresh_database()
  OR
  Client clicks REFRESH CLIENT to send HTTP request to php_assessment/includes/refresh_client.php via main.js function refresh_client().
  
**Route #2 **

  SERVER returns html generated by index.php to client
  OR
  SERVER either sends a server information message or "Database refreshed!" message to the client. Javascript on the client loads message into the #mainContent element
  OR
  SERVER either sends a server information message or HTTP response that presents the repository information retrieved from the MySQL database. Javascript on the client loads repository list items into the #mainContent element.
  
**Route #3 **

  SERVER sends a query string to MySQL database to request repository data.
  
**Route #4 **

  MySQL returns the database results that we retrieve via mysqli_fetch_array PHP function and create repository list items within collapsible div element. 
  
**Route #5 **

  cURL session is created and executed to retrieve JSON encoded string from https://api.github.com/search/repositories API endpoint.
  
**Route #6 **

  GitHub responds to route #5 request with JSON encoded repository data.
